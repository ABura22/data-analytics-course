# Module 3: Intro to SQL 

## Overview: 
This SQL module provides an introductory exploration into the fundamental concepts and skills needed to effectively query and manipulate data using Structured Query Language (SQL). This one-week module covers essential topics such as writing basic `SELECT` statements to retrieve data, filtering results with the `WHERE` clause, sorting data using `ORDER BY`, and employing aggregation functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, and `AVG` to summarize information. By the end of the module, students will apply their SQL skills to query the student application data from Module 2, conducting an in-depth analysis and writing a long-form report to summarize their findings, demonstrating their ability to draw insights from real-world data using SQL.
