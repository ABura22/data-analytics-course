# Module 3: Intro to SQL 

## Overview: 
This section provides an introductory exploration into the fundamental concepts and skills needed to effectively query and manipulate data using Structured Query Language (SQL). 

The module covers essential topics such as writing basic `SELECT` statements to retrieve data, filtering results with the `WHERE` clause, sorting data using `ORDER BY`, and employing aggregation functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, and `AVG` to summarize information. 

By the end of the module, students will apply their SQL skills to query the student application data from Module 2, conducting an in-depth analysis and writing a long-form report to summarize their findings, demonstrating their ability to draw insights from real-world data using SQL.

## Learning Outcomes: 

1. Understand SQL Basics: Demonstrate a foundational understanding of SQL and its role in data analysis, including how to set up and navigate a SQL environment.

2. Retrieve Data Using SQL: Write basic SELECT statements to extract data from a single table, identifying specific columns and rows as needed.

3. Filter and Sort Data: Apply the WHERE clause to filter query results based on specific conditions and use ORDER BY to sort data in ascending or descending order.

4. Aggregate and Summarize Data: Utilize aggregation functions such as COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX to perform calculations on data sets, and group data using GROUP BY to generate summary reports.

5. Conduct Data Analysis: Independently query the student application data used in Module 2, applying SQL techniques learned in the module to analyze the data.

6. Communicate Findings: Compile a long-form report summarizing the findings from their SQL queries, demonstrating their ability to interpret data and present insights in a clear, concise manner.
