Getting Started with Excel/Google Sheets

1. What is Excel/Google Sheets? 

* Excel is a spreadsheet program developed by Microsoft.
* Google Sheets is a similar web-based application by Google.
* Both tools are used for organizing, analyzing, and storing data.

In this class you can choose to use either one of these tools based on your personal perference and what you might currently need to learn for your job. 
The examples will be done in google sheets, however, the concepts translate over to Excel. 

2. Data Import and Cleaning 

Data import and cleaning are crucial steps in any data analysis workflow. When working with data in Excel or Google Sheets, you often need to bring in data from various sources such as CSV files, databases, or web pages. Importing data correctly ensures that your data is structured and ready for analysis. However, raw data is rarely perfect; it may contain errors, inconsistencies, duplicates, or irrelevant information. This is where data cleaning comes into play. Data cleaning involves removing duplicates, correcting errors, handling missing values, and transforming data into a usable format. For example, if you are analyzing applicant data for a training program, you might find entries with missing information, inconsistent formatting of dates, or duplicate records of the same applicant. Cleaning this data ensures accuracy and reliability in your analysis, leading to more meaningful insights and better decision-making. Effective data cleaning can significantly enhance the quality of your analysis, allowing you to derive accurate and actionable insights from your data.

Step 1: Download the .csv file 

Step 2: Import the data into your spreadsheet tool of choice

* Excel: Use the "Data" tab to import from various sources like CSV, text files, or directly from the web.
* Google Sheets: Use "File > Import" to upload files or import from Google Drive.

Step 3: Review Columns and Understanding Data 

Before diving into cleaning, it’s essential to review all columns in your dataset and understand what each column represents. This initial step helps you identify the types of data you are working with and ensures that you are aware of the meaning and significance of each column. For instance, in a dataset of applicant information, you should know what each column, such as "Applicant ID," "Name," "Age," "Previous Job," "Current Status," "Skills," "Training Completed," and "Desired Job," represents. If you encounter a column whose meaning is unclear, you can take several steps:

* Consult Documentation: Check if there is any accompanying documentation or data dictionary that explains the columns.
* Ask Stakeholders: Reach out to the person or team who provided the data to clarify the column’s meaning.
* Infer from Context: Look at the data entries in the column and try to infer its purpose from the values it contains.

3. Cleaning the Data 

After understanding your data, you can proceed with cleaning it. This involves several tasks:

1) Removing Duplicates:
Excel: Use "Data > Remove Duplicates".
Google Sheets: Use "Data > Data cleanup > Remove duplicates"

2) Text to Columns:
Excel: Use "Data > Text to Columns" to split text into different columns.
Google Sheets: Use "Data > Split text to columns".

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Sorting and Filtering Data

    * Sort data by selecting the column header and choosing the sort option.
    * Apply filters to view specific subsets of your data.

* Descriptive Statistics

    * Calculate basic statistics like mean, median, mode, and standard deviation using built-in functions.

5. Creating Pivot Tables and Charts

* Pivot Tables

    * Excel: Use "Insert > PivotTable" and follow the prompts to create a pivot table.
    * Google Sheets: Use "Data > Pivot table" to create and customize your pivot table.

* Charts

    * Excel: Use "Insert > Chart" and choose the type of chart that best represents your data.
    * Google Sheets: Use "Insert > Chart" to create various types of charts, such as bar, line, and pie charts.
