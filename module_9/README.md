# Module 9: Introduction to Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)

## Module Overview
In this module, students will explore the foundations of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Students will learn how ML uses data to make predictions and uncover patterns, the history and evolution of AI, and practical applications of AI tools in modern workflows. They will also gain hands-on experience critiquing AI-generated data analysis to understand its strengths and limitations.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, students will be able to:
- Understand the basic concepts of Machine Learning and its reliance on data.
- Summarize a brief history of Artificial Intelligence.
- Identify and differentiate between various roles AI can play, such as a tutor and a coach.
- Recognize key AI tools like Claude, MidJourney, Bing, ChatGPT, and NotebookLM.
- Critique AI-generated analyses to assess their validity, strengths, and weaknesses.

## Module Outline

### 1. Introduction to Machine Learning and AI
- **What is Machine Learning?**  
  - Machine Learning is a subset of AI that uses data to train algorithms to make predictions or identify patterns.  
  - Examples of ML applications: fraud detection, recommendation systems, predictive analytics.
- **Brief History of AI**  
  - Early concepts: Alan Turing and the Turing Test.  
  - AI winters and breakthroughs in neural networks.  
  - Current developments in generative AI.

### 2. Different Roles AI Can Play
From the book by Ethan Mollick: *Co-intelligence* on human-AI collaboration
- **AI as a Tutor**  
  - Example: AI assisting with personalized learning or providing real-time feedback.
- **AI as a Coach**  
  - Example: AI tools helping with motivation, strategy, or creativity (e.g., brainstorming).  

### 3. Exploring AI Tools
- Overview of popular AI tools:
  - **Claude**: Conversational AI for brainstorming and text processing.  
  - **MidJourney**: AI for creating artistic visuals.  
  - **Bing AI**: Search and information retrieval with AI assistance.  
  - **ChatGPT**: Versatile generative AI for tasks like text generation and data analysis.  
  - **NotebookLM**: AI for organizing and summarizing research.

# Assignment
**Task #1:** Upload a dataset to an AI service for analysis.  
Recommended tool: **ChatGPT** (with the Code Interpreter/Advanced Data Analysis feature).  

#### Steps:
1. Find a medium-sized dataset (e.g., CSV file with 1,000-10,000 rows).
2. Upload the dataset to ChatGPT or another AI tool with data analysis capabilities.  
3. Use the following prompt for the analysis:  

> "Analyze this dataset. Provide a summary of key patterns, any anomalies, and actionable insights. Create visualizations if possible. Include an explanation of your methodology."

* Additional Notes 
   - For free AI tools, ChatGPT (with the free-tier Code Interpreter) or Bing AI are the best options for this assignment.  

#### Critique Guidelines:
- **Verification**: Compare the AI's analysis to your expectations or manually verified results.  
- **Positives**: What did the AI do well? Were the insights clear and relevant?  
- **Negatives**: What did the AI miss? Were there any errors in interpretation or visualizations?  
- **Reflection**: Discuss how this experience could influence your future use of AI in data analysis.


**Task #2:** Write a 1 -2 page reflective report 

**Instructions:**  
- Summarize the AI analysis experience, including the critique of the output.  
- Highlight key learnings from the module on AI and ML.  
- Discuss how you see yourself using AI tools in your future projects.
