This means seeking roles that not only allow me to apply my current knowledge and skills but also provide a conducive environment for growth and learning in this specific field. Whether it's a job in a tech company, a research assistantship, or an internship, I'm looking for a stepping stone that will set me on the right path towards my long-term ambitions.  For my long-term goals, I am deeply committed to advancing in the field of machine learning. This journey includes obtaining a Master's degree followed by a PhD. I aim to immerse myself in intensive research and academic study, contributing to groundbreaking work in machine learning. My vision is to not just become a practitioner in this field, but a thought leader and innovator, pushing the boundaries of what's possible with artificial intelligence.","Embarking on a career in tech as a new IT graduate and a mother, I faced several daunting barriers. The challenge of breaking into a fast-paced, ever-evolving industry while balancing family life loomed large. Deciding where to start in the vast tech landscape was my first hurdle, as I weighed which specialization would offer both professional growth and work-life balance. Navigating the steep learning curve of new technologies while managing motherhood was a constant juggle. Additionally, as someone re-entering the workforce, building a professional network from scratch in a field that highly values connections was daunting.","In March 2023, my life transformed in the most profound way imaginable. I gave birth to twins, a milestone that symbolizes joy and renewal. However, this joyous occasion was almost overshadowed by a harrowing ordeal – a uterine rupture that threatened not just my life but the lives of my newborns. It was a moment suspended between triumph and tragedy, where every second felt like an eternity, and the thin line between life and death became starkly evident.  Miraculously, we all prevailed. Emerging from this brink of despair, I was cradled in a newfound appreciation for life. This experience taught me about the fragility and resilience of human existence. It made me acutely aware of the preciousness of each breath, each moment I spent with my family, and the incredible gift of a second chance that so many yearn for but few receive.  This harrowing journey has imprinted a profound lesson in my heart: the importance of staying present in everyday life. The laughter of my twins, their tiny fingers wrapped around mine, the shared glances of love and gratitude with my partner – these are not just fleeting moments, but treasures to be cherished deeply. Each day is a canvas of possibilities, and I've learned to paint it with the colors of mindfulness and joy, never taking for granted the second chance I've been given.  In the face of this life-altering challenge, I emerged not just as a survivor but as a beacon of hope and strength, with a renewed sense of purpose and a deeper connection to the precious, fleeting moments of life.","I am set to graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology in 2024, which has provided me with a strong foundation in various technical domains. Throughout my academic journey, I have engaged in several coding projects that have allowed me to develop proficiency in languages such as JavaScript and Java, among others.

These projects ranged from creating web applications using JavaScript to developing software solutions in Java. This hands-on experience has not only honed my coding skills but also enhanced my problem-solving abilities and understanding of practical applications in technology.

In addition to these programming languages, my coursework and self-driven learning efforts have exposed me to a broad spectrum of other technologies and tools relevant to the IT field. This includes foundational knowledge in database management, network administration, and an understanding of basic cybersecurity principles.

While I may not have extensive professional experience yet, these academic projects and my coursework have equipped me with a solid technical skill set and a keen enthusiasm for further learning and application in the tech industry.",,,Hispanic or Latina,,,,12/8/2023 8:56 PM,,recU5RI3FPEtitW0w,https://airtable.com/shr1fzOzyoKPI9VJt?prefill_Link+to+Tech+Moms+Applications+Table=recU5RI3FPEtitW0w&hide_Link+to+Tech+Moms+Applications+Table=true,L,1223,https://airtable.com/appC7LKIP4AccWSht/shrKDpOExqrphWlgG?prefill_Link+to+Tech+Moms+Applications+Table=recU5RI3FPEtitW0w&hide_Link+to+Tech+Moms+Applications+Table=true

However, during my internship at Dev Div at Microsoft I was required to develop Desk Applications (compared to Web) under the Microsoft toolset.

Understanding Visual Studio’s extensions architecture and how they run on assemblies designed to execute tasks simultaneously while learning C# was difficult. The development tool was different, the code, the packing and execution, and also the strategies to run instructions in parallel. I researched and read the documentation, watched videos and experimented in code for learning new concepts like assemblies, Model-View-ViewModel, MSBuild architecture and accessing data stored inside MSBuild files, OOP design, C#, Xaml and .Net framework. I was tasked with writing an extension (Extension Publisher) in C# for Visual Studio, using the new VisualStudio.Extensibility desktop application architecture.

1665,Applicant,Applied,Salt Lake City,Utah,checked,1,Laptop (PC),Employed full-time (35 hrs+),Individual Contributor,Administrative Assistant,$35K-$50K,Married,$50k - $75k,Bachelor's Degree,"My short-term goal is to enhance my skills and knowledge in the tech industry, particularly in web development and related fields. Through programs like TechMoms, I aim to gain practical experience and expertise that will enable me to transition into more specialized roles within the tech sector.  In the long term, I aspire to establish myself as a respected professional in the tech industry, leveraging my background in marketing and economics alongside my newfound skills in web development. I envision contributing to innovative projects, collaborating with diverse teams, and making meaningful contributions to the advancement of technology.  Beyond career advancement, my overarching goal is to achieve a sense of fulfillment and balance in both my professional and personal life. I aim to create a career path that aligns with my values, allows me to continue growing and learning, and provides a stable and secure future for myself and my daughter.  Ultimately, I see myself as a trailblazer, breaking barriers and inspiring others, especially women and mothers, to pursue their passions and realize their full potential in the tech industry and beyond.","The biggest barriers I face in my career encompass a range of factors that intersect with my personal and professional life. Firstly, the challenge of not having the right experience, compounded by my age and the perception that I am not freshly graduated from college, presents a significant hurdle. In industries where networking is paramount, the adage ""it's not what you know, but who you know"" rings especially true, posing a challenge for someone like me who may not have extensive connections.  Being a woman and a mother adds another layer of complexity. Balancing the demands of motherhood while striving to maintain and progress in a career can be incredibly challenging. Despite strides towards gender equality, societal norms and workplace biases can still present obstacles for women, particularly mothers, in advancing their careers.  Furthermore, my education, while valuable, may be considered dated in rapidly evolving industries. Keeping pace with the latest developments and acquiring new skills is essential for professional growth, yet it can be time-consuming, especially when juggling full-time work and parenting responsibilities. Time, indeed, is a significant barrier. Finding the time and resources to dedicate to learning new skills while fulfilling my existing commitments is a constant challenge.  Despite these barriers, I am determined to overcome them. Through perseverance, continuous learning, and leveraging my strengths and experiences, I am committed to carving out a fulfilling and successful career path for myself, one that reflects both my professional aspirations and personal responsibilities.","One significant challenge I faced, both professionally and personally, was navigating through a series of mental health issues following the birth of my daughter. Postpartum depression, compounded by grief from the loss of two close friends, the stress of the pandemic, and the blow of being laid off during such uncertain times, created a perfect storm of challenges.  In the midst of this tumultuous period, I learned invaluable lessons about resilience and self-care. I discovered the importance of reaching out for support, whether from loved ones or mental health professionals. Meditation became my anchor, providing solace and clarity amidst chaos. I also learned to recognize unhealthy coping mechanisms, such as turning to alcohol, and instead focused on healthier outlets for managing stress and emotions.  This journey underscored the preciousness of mental health and the necessity of maintaining balance in all aspects of life. Through self-awareness and the tools I acquired, I emerged stronger and more equipped to face future challenges with grace and resilience. It taught me that it's okay to ask for help, to prioritize self-care, and to approach life's ups and downs with a sense of mindfulness and balance.","While my primary expertise lies in customer service, marketing, and administrative work, I have gained valuable technical experience throughout my career. I have proficiency in various software and tools essential for digital marketing and project management.

In my role at Spherion Staffing, I utilized platforms like PostBeyond and HootSuite for social media management, demonstrating my ability to leverage technology to increase brand visibility and engagement. Additionally, I have experience with design software such as Canva, which I used to create promotional materials and marketing collateral.

Moreover, my tenure at Visit Salt Lake provided me with opportunities to develop skills in CRM software like Simpleview CRM, enhancing my ability to manage client relationships and streamline communication processes.

Currently, in my position as Corporate and Facilities Administrator at MarketStar, I continue to expand my technical proficiency by utilizing Microsoft Office programs, Google Suite applications, and other tools to support organizational needs efficiently.

While my technical experience may not be the focal point of my career, I have demonstrated a willingness to adapt and learn new technologies as needed to excel in my roles. I am confident in my ability to leverage these skills effectively and contribute to the success of any project or team.

Within ten years, I aim to attend the University of Michigan to pursue either a Masters of Public Administration: Non-profit Management emphasis or Masters of Public Policy. My long-term career goal is to co-found a non-profit summer camp and event center for families with a member with cerebral palsy. I intend to select all the career steps I take between now and then because they will help me become increasingly equipped to run a non-profit.","While attending classes, I enrolled my youngest at the Wee Care Center. After a handful of conversations, the center director Jolene Merica extended a job offer to me. I started working two hours a week and was surprised to learn that I loved working. I quickly adjusted to 10 hours a week, then 20. I gravitated toward data analytics, research, and event planning. After two and half months, Dr. Merica asked if I would apply as their full-time CCAMPIS Grant Coordinator. I initially hesitated, still uncertain that full-time employment was a safe ground to be on. While I pondered, Dr. Merica continued to mentor me in developing skills that would make me the best candidate for the position. I eventually applied and was hired full-time in January 2022. I love my job. I love working full-time. I am happy and thriving at work and home and feel increasingly recharged as I devote my passion more fully to both roles. I cherish all that I learned in Family Science and learned what I needed to step outside of my small view of the world. Now that I know my professional-self better, I wish I had chosen a more employable field of study. I long to embrace my interest in technology and develop the skills and the training for higher technology integration in my career path. I am enthusiastic as a Grant Coordinator and thoroughly enjoy my current employment. Our current 4-year grant cycle ends in September of this year. I am currently part of a great team working on our next grant application. The CCAMPIS grant funding has shifted; 4 years ago, 212 applicants were awarded; in this next cycle, only 83 applicants will be awarded. We are preparing a highly competitive, data- and research-backed request for funding. I am optimistic that we will be funded. However, if we are among the large majority not selected, my work contract will not be renewed, and I will seek a new full-time job. To obtain the type of employment I will thrive in, I intend to become better equipped to work in technology.","I was raised in a home with strict traditional gender roles. I am grateful that my parents found a family structure that worked well for them. They swam against the tide and ended generational patterns of severe abuse and neglect. My childhood was incredibly happy. My parents often emphasized that I should follow the mom as homemaker/nurturer model and never work. I was taught that I should stop any aspirations that weren’t motherhood. I moved from Michigan to Utah to attend BYU as a 16-year-old. Even at that young age, my parents only advised me to “major in the program you want your husband to have a career in, get married, and drop out of school.” As a freshman, I was invited to join my professor’s research team. I discussed the invitation with my parents, who cautioned that the opportunity might sway me towards a career. Not only did they recommend I not join the team, but they also suggested I switch majors. I did. That pattern continued; I dropped my classes every time a passion for a field was ignited in me, afraid that if I loved what I was learning, I would choose a career over motherhood. I hadn’t known that both could be an option—my fascination with learning and desire to contribute to my world as a mother and professionally never faded. Eventually, I decided to finish my undergraduate education. After earning an associate degree in early childhood education, I enrolled in Utah Valley University’s online Family Science bachelorette program. Even in such a “mom-friendly” program, my parents still called me to caution against “anything that might distract from being a mother.” As part of my coursework, I studied Family Policy and the American Safety Net by Janet Giele. Dr. Giele’s insights opened my mind to a much larger world. I learned of remarkable women accomplishing a satisfying dual mission as both mother and professional. I realized that the “traditional” home model is only one of many ways to have a successful home life. My coursework helped me develop a growth mindset and cultivated the drive and courage to follow a life path right for my family and me. I will earn my Bachelor of Science in Family Science this August. Overcoming this challenge has taught me to embrace and follow my passion, celebrate growth, and anticipate getting up from a fall to try again.

In the long term I’d like a flexible work/life balance that can allow me to provide for and also be with my children as they grow.,"I think the three biggest barriers to my career right now are the 16 years I’ve been out of the work force, the need to get good child care for all of my children, and the limitations imposed on my earning because of the divorce regarding child support. ","Right now I’m in the middle of overcoming the most difficult challenge I have ever had. A few months ago, when I was 2 months pregnant with our 7th baby, my husband of 17 years made a decisions that crossed a bright line for me. Just a few months later I found out he’d made many more bright line decisions.   In this emotional and shocking time I mustered the courage to separate from my husband. This carried tough financial consequences. I had been a stay home mom to our seven magnificent children for 16 years. So we had at times almost no income. He kicked me out of our home while I was in the hospital giving birth. I had to help my kids start school during that time from my parents’ home. In facing this challenge, I put myself into the place of my beautiful daughters. What would I want for them if they were in this situation? Then I looked at my beautiful sons. What should I teach them about how to treat their future wives and honor their own families? The answer was clear: I would want safety, respect and dignity for all of them so I needed to choose it for myself too.   During this struggle, I have learned to care for and strengthen my own mental health. I have dealt with the difficult financial pressures through the help of strong women and men in my family, church and community. I have found a safe place to be in my parents’ home for me and my children.   Now I am building a financial plan for our future that will take care of us well. We hope it will allow us to stay in the neighborhood and schools that we love. I hope that Tech Moms can be a part of that financial trajectory for me and my family.",Twenty years ago I learned C and Java.

They asked me to be the store Safety Manager. The store had been inspected and the inspector was waiting to go over the results at that very moment. Knowing nothing about the regulations I went into the meeting and was given a list of 76 infractions that needed to be addressed as soon as possible. These infractions ranged from very complicated construction issues, to organizational issues, bad habits, and most importantly a non existant training schedule and program. I Immediatly got to work while continuing to keep up on my other responsibilities. I created a training program and implimented it. This took time because the department managers were not very open to change. I created my own inspection schedule to check up on all departments on a regular basis and show them that I was taking this responsibility seriously, I really wanted to make sure everyone was safe while working. I worked to resolve every issue I could and often times had to be very creative to solve specific problems. I had to create solutions that would be simple to impliment in our store culture while still fulfilling corporate requirements. Though many things took time and persistance and others took reaching out to outside sources to fix structural issues I continued to see steady improvement and less infractions every 6 month inspection. At the last inspection I had narrowed it down to only 4 infractions of very minimal significance.  Through this experience I learned a lot about compromise and team work. I had to come up with fixes, organizational programs, and training programs for departments that I knew very little about. I worked with each Manager to find solutions that would work for their specific department and work culture. I had to be patient and understanding as my coworkers got into the habit of the new policies. I learned that when working with coworkers expecially when they ""out rank"" you the best way to encourage them to make changes is to show them respect and involve them in the process. To work with them and ask for their input in solving the issues. When others are involved in the solution and they understand the reason the changes need to be made the changes happen.

Now, I am eager to embark on a new chapter of personal and professional growth. My goal is to transition into a career that not only accommodates the flexibility I cherish for family moments but also challenges me in exciting new ways. I am enthusiastic about learning, evolving, and contributing to a field that aligns with my values and allows me to make a positive impact.","A significant challenge I encounter results from a combination of factors. Firstly, my inherent nature tends to be reserved, although I am actively engaged in efforts to enhance my communication skills and networking abilities. Secondly, the workplace dynamic poses an additional hurdle, given that I am among the few women in management within my current organization. Negotiating the balance between being outspoken and ensuring my voice is heard can be challenging in this context. While women are increasingly encouraged to express themselves, there remains a risk of not being fully heard or acknowledged. However, I've observed positive changes in recent years, fostering a more inclusive environment. Through continuous learning, supportive relationships, and effective networking, I aim to cultivate the confidence and technological proficiency necessary to emerge as a formidable and influential leader.","One of the most significant challenges I faced was when my daughter was born, coinciding with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Upon delivering my baby, I received the unexpected news that I had tested positive for COVID-19. This unfortunate circumstance meant that my family couldn't be with me during this crucial time. As the saying goes, ""it takes a village to raise a child,"" and I truly felt the absence of my family's presence during those initial moments of becoming a mother for the first time. Navigating this challenging period without the support of my immediate family was tough. Fortunately, my husband played a pivotal role as a source of unwavering support.

I have survived off of making $8,000 in an entire year, and I'm not going back to that.  I know that I want to be able to sleep at night knowing that even if I'm sick I can still work.  I need to be able to work remotely, but am also willing to go into an office every few days if needed.  I currently can only work about 17-18 hours a week right now, and work as a cashier at a restaurant.  I make $10.80 an hour, plus tips that are split with other cashiers on that shift with me.  I'm able to barely pay my bills and I can afford to eat decent food again, and I'm so grateful I can.  Now that I've seen that I'm capable again of working hard, I'm determined to work on my education so that I don't have to rely on anybody for my safety and health.  I'd love to eventually be able to be great at coding, website building, designing, and maybe even animation at some point!  I'm interested in so many different things and am excited to explore as many options as possible!","I don't have a degree.  I am a certified Cosmetologist, but the chemicals and long hours of standing drastically increased my health issues.

I'm able to take classes now, but I don't have the money, can only do one class at a time, and need to take breaks often.  My student debt would be astronomical because of how long it would take me to get through.  I have health issues for life and I'm not confident quite yet that I'd be able to handle college.  Not only that, but college doesn't feel right to me in any way, and that's usually a sign that I am needed to explore different options.  I can handle a few months of classes, but I'm not strong enough yet to take on the difficulties of being on my own and trying to get a degree.  I'm best at working closely with others, learning on the job, and having hands-on practice.  This course is the best option for me because it has every one of those criteria met!  ","My biggest challenge has been learning how to do what's best for me despite what others say.  My family has a strong personality and I let their opinions of me control my mood and life as a whole.  I'm still not amazing at doing what's best for me, but learning to listen to myself and only do things I know are best for me has changed my life.  I previously couldn't hold a job, had chronic depression and anxiety, couldn't eat food without becoming extremely sick, and spent most of my days in bed.  Thankfully I found an amazing person here in Mesa who's helped me work through my traumas, been supportive of me when I'm unsure of myself, and has encouraged me that it's worth it to keep looking for ways to improve my health.  Currently I am able to eat foods I never thought I could, I can go into public again without debilitating anxiety, I have healthy boundaries with family, and for the first time in over a decade I'm able to think about a future.  Before I started making progress with my overall health I couldn't comprehend that I had a future of any kind and knew (at least it seemed like a truth to me) that I was going to die soon in one way or another.  That inability to plan for the future made it impossible for me to make progress, and through very hard work and supportive people in my life I can finally think again.  I don't remember the last time I was this hopeful, and I don't want to waste it because of past fears.  I've had extreme difficulty with schooling where I can't remember anything the teachers tell me, but I'm confident I can do it this time.  I know it's going to be hard, and I'm going to be frustrated, and I'm going to have to put in twice the work, but I'm ready for it.

After graduation, I got heavily into running as it was the easiest alternative to sports. It fed my soul to go running. Then, my sophomore year of college I noticed a twinge in my knee and it continued to get worse. To make a long story short, 14 years later I still cannot run and now know that my pelvis will always have issues and it causes problems all down my leg. It is difficult to explain how heart breaking it has been to realize that I have a chronic condition that will always affect how active I can be, or how long I can sit. However, I have come to many crossroads in this journey that I have chosen to accept the pain, accept the identity change, accept limitations and be grateful for what I can still do. Since there are many things I love that I cannot do any more I am decided to use that time to lean into trying new things that I am terrible at. It feels so awful but so good to be so bad at something and then learn to love it. I have learned to play the violin a bit, water paint, garden, sew, and more all because I have more time to focus on other things. When one door closes another opens and for that I am grateful.   I have learned that I can make even difficult situations a good experience. There is always room to accept and feel the heartbreaks but there is also always room for the gratitude for experiences of the present moment. I do my best to turn lemons into lemonade.

","One of my biggest challenges was when I took over as news director for KSL.com. I was a non-traditional student who graduated in my late 20s, who worked for two years as a reporter and then two years as a web journalist when I took over. My job was to help the team I led become respected journalists while navigating some tricky internal organizational politics. Until recently, online news teams were seen by many legacy journalists as being less skilled and credible.Some of this reputation was definitely earned in the early days of the internet, when well-intended web journalists played fast and loose with things like attribution and fair use, and many disregarded veteran journalists’ knowledge and experience. The team I inherited was smart and hard-working, but had often been overlooked because they were web journalists. I was determined to help them feel more confident and become more respected. I  helped them establish processes to improve their writing, editing and decision-making. At the same time, I learned all I could and then taught the team about legal liability in journalism. I regularly held lunch and learn seminars for my team to learn from and teach others in the broader newsroom, and took advantage of as much training for myself and my team as possible. As a team, we improved and tried to help those around us improve. We kept winning local and regional industry awards that saw team members’ journalism outperform some veteran journalists’. Finally, three years into my tenure, the KSL.com team and I finally received fitting validation: Our website was awarded “Best News-Oriented Website” in Utah by a team of journalism peers.","I've taken seminars here and there on R, SQL and advanced Excel, but haven't put much into play otherwise.

We have four children, all of which have ADD or ADHD. Two of those also have Autism and one of those two has significant other disabilities. Through the years it has been a big challenge to see that they are able to get the resources that they are in need of. I am continually needing to push for services in school.  There have also been a variety of different circumstances where we need to get creative in solving them. In their younger years my husband was working two jobs in order to pay off medical bills. He was gone 90 hours in a 9 day period plus his commute. During those 90 hours every other week I was very much on my own in caring for our kids. It was very tricky shuttling them around to their various activities, especially when there is alway the possibility of meltdowns and run aways.  For example public bathrooms with our littles was near impossible and very stressful. So in our van we have a pop up potty tent and a camping potty with water and biodegradable soap to avoid having to deal with using public restrooms. In fact in my van I have an arsenal of supplies to try to head off any possible problem.  Whenever we have a situation where I am not prepared, I will add whatever we were missing to the arsenal and you better believe we were prepared the next go around. Financially it has been a challenge to raise kids with special needs. There are expensive medical needs but also there is always extra expenses to supplement their learning in ways they can understand. Unfortunately I was unable to complete past my junior year in college because we had our son with Autism and I needed to focus on his care. Even if I were able to work, one of us needed to be with our son.  So my husband went to college during the day and while he was studying and putting our son to bed I would work as a cashier at night. Later in his career he worked two jobs. Now I work at night from 8:30pm -2am  fulfilling orders at a warehouse after my husband returns from work.  This year is the first time in 12 years that all my kids will be in school for a full day.  So it has been hard and we have had to make sacrifices and get creative at times. But what we have learned and what we are trying to teach our kids is that we can do hard things.

In the end, I ended up buying us a new home, got all of our goods unpacked, and found a career at the University of Utah.

As of now, my short term goals are to get more experience in the tech industry and expand my skills in this area as much as possible. My long term career goals are to be able to comfortably support myself and my family on my own if necessary, eventually fulfill a management roll in whatever STEM based career I choose, and to help pave a way for other women in this area.","Overcoming barriers for women in STEM, and financial security. ","The biggest challenge I have faced in my career as a woman in STEM is learning how to overcome the barriers placed in my way because I am a woman. During my six-year tenure as an analytical chemist, I became the primary trainer for my department, was considered a worldwide expert in my field, and designed a new testing method approved by the FDA. Despite all my contributions, I ran into many situations of sexism in the workplace that tried to undermine my intelligence and expertise. One example arose after working at a high level for several years when I trained a man in his thirties to do specific assay testing. Despite not having more education level or experience, he was almost immediately used as the primary person to direct questions to within our department. As he knew much less than me about the assay and had not trained the new analysts, he did not know what would be appropriate in most cases and would refer to me for guidance. The male coworker offered to raise concerns in my staid because he told me that he recognized they took him more seriously than me, which I appreciated, but this did not solve my concerns. I was also skipped over for raises and promotions for my less experienced male colleagues and many other examples. Initially, when I raised my concerns with management, I asked them to explain their decision-making process and asked if there was something I needed to improve in my performance that I may be missing. They said they had no explanation for the decisions and no negative feedback about my performance. I asked if they had no reason was it perhaps related to my gender or age, and they brushed off my concerns. However, I started documenting specific instances and dates this occurred, recorded conversations in meetings where appropriate, and kept a list of my contributions to the company. After compiling substantial evidence, I brought this to management's attention again, and I was able to get them to admit there was an issue. Moving forward, they agreed to implement training on gender bias into the standard yearly training. While the issue did not go away overnight, I saw a marked improvement in how I was treated along with other women in my department. I learned that sometimes people are blind to their own biases and that I needed to stand up for myself and others in these situations with well documented evidence if at all possible.

I would call many students daily, and though my role was meant only to be academic, it often would turn into a kind of counseling. Students would confide about their mental health and family issues. We were told to direct them towards community services, since we weren’t trained. During one call, a student was obviously very depressed. It was pointless to talk about schoolwork because he found life itself to be pointless. I listened to his reasons and realized he felt that way because he didn’t believe anyone loved him. I felt woefully unprepared, but tried to comfort him. After the call ended I contacted his mom, to alert her of his state, as well as my supervisor for advice. He suggested tips for maneuvering those types of conversations and said I had done well, even with the lack of preparation. More calls similar to that particular call, would follow. I learned that I needed to be prepared for uncomfortable situations. Sometimes that means doing research or asking for help ahead of time, sometimes making mistakes is inevitable. That experience, and others in my personal and professional life, strengthen the life-perspective that making mistakes is a part of learning—it’s necessary to growth, and isn’t something to be ashamed or scared of.

I've done some research and like the looks of data analyst, tech writer, user experience, and there are several others, plus coding, that I'm interested in. So, short term goals is to learn about those and try to become one, which I need help doing. I also want to get a WFH job to protect my health. Long term goals: I want to be good at tech and what I do. I can see myself working for a nonprofit on the tech side, because even though I want to move away from my librarian career, I still have a passion for helping people and the community and want to continue doing that. ","I'm past 40, so I think changing careers will be harder for me, in that that is what potential employees might focus on instead of what I have to offer. I myself do not believe my age means I will learn less, work less, etc.  I also don't have money to go back to school or do a code camp, so that's another barrier. When I've talked to people about my current career - librarian - most of them don't think my experience and skills will transfer well. I believe it will, but don't want to end up in entry-level customer support since that is what most directly translates to another job, but I need to be able to put something on my resume other than librarian to help prove that. ","I hope this isn't too broad, but one thing I keep coming across both professionally and personally is that I need to keep learning and doing things on my own. A lot of times at work, for many years, I'm asked to do things but not given the tools I need to succeed. I have learned how to find those tools on my own, including asking for support from those around me, and then learn how to apply it to my job to fix things or succeed in what I've been asked to do. Part of this is being willing to risk failure, because I have to take responsibility for the outcomes. I have come to realize that this also applies to my personal life, that I just can't say 'no more, I can't do it any more.' That doesn't solve things, I need to keep going, keep learning, and keep trying, even when I want to give up. When I want to give up or I'm worried about failure, I make myself look at all the years where I accomplished hard things by learning and being willing to fail when implementing what I learned. I most often succeed, so I've learned I just need to keep going, keep learning, and keep taking responsibility for both success and failure, but the failure can't stop me.","At my current job, I'm the one who is supposed to talk to tech people and ask them to fix things. I don't fix it, but I identify that there is a problem and figure out what company is the one I should be talking to - we have several different vendors plus city techs who are contract and off site. Sometimes I help the tech person remote in so they can do their thing. I know a bit about networking.

489,2022 Spring - Ogden,Assigned Cohort,Logan,Utah,,0,Laptop (PC),Employed full-time (35 hrs+),Individual Contributor,Placement Coordinator,$25K-$35K,Married,$35k - $50k,Bachelor's Degree,"Short term, I would like to start my own business as a side gig to start. I want to not live paycheck to paycheck, and support my husband in his dreams while also fulfilling my own. Long term, I would like to work entirely for my own business, and help small women run businesses get started. I spent 2 years in business consulting and 3 years in Business Licensing, as well as 5 years volunteering as a victim advocate. I feel like my unique job history enables me to help other women become financially independent and prioritize themselves and their abilities. I would like to buy a house with some land to run a small, sustainable homestead. Long term I want to build myself a career I love, spend plenty of time with my family, and enable my husband to forge his own path as well. ","My biggest barrier in my career has been my lack of confidence in my work. I feel like for many years, I let my anxiety rule my path. I worked hard but often fell into jobs that I wasn't passionate about. Aside from my current job which I haven't been in for more than a year, I have been promoted at every job I've been at. However, I feel like going along with some odd promotions over the years led me on a path that wasn't my own. I let others dictate my path for me. When I worked for a small city in Salt Lake County, I was promoted from a job in Criminal Justice, to a Business Role. I took it since I knew I thought it would be best for my future, but I didn't think about the fact that I knew nothing about business. Now I've spent 6 years in business and feel like I let others forge a path for me, instead of taking my own. I would like to reclaim my path for myself, and build confidence and trust in myself and my choices. I have grown to love a lot of aspects about business but want to tie it to my history of working in the public sector and helping others. ","This last year and a half was easily the most difficult time in my life. After the pandemic hit in March of 2020, my husband quit his job so I could continue to caretake for my mom during the pandemic without any possible COVID exposure. He was the breadwinner of our home, so within a month I became the breadwinner of our house and spent all my free time taking care of my terminally ill mother. A couple months into the pandemic, my husband decided he didn't want to go back to real estate and wanted to go back to school. We picked up everything and moved to Logan, Utah. A smaller college town where we knew no one so I could support his new career path in plant genetics. He started working again but only part time as a landscaper. I would drive every week from Logan to West Jordan and spend the weekends taking care of my mom, and the other half of the week with my husband in Logan. My mom passed away in August of 2020, and by October of 2020 I lost my job due to my move to Logan, and I got COVID. By the end of the year, I had hit a depressive state. I didn't have trouble finding a new job, but I also took a pay cut due to lack of opportunities in a small town. I also chose a job at the University specifically so my husband could get a discount at school. In one year, we went from making around $140K Gross as a couple, to making less than $50K. Over the past year, I've learned that I tend to constantly put my life on hold for other. First, for my mother to take care of her for the 6 years prior to her death. Then, I started to do the same for my husband. He is actually the one who pointed this out to me and is encouraging me to grow for myself for once, and not do something for others. Over the last year I also learned how to budget so my husband and I still live comfortably even though we have a lot less money. I've spent the last year reflecting on what I want to do and growing as a person on my own. I want to grow into a career to help others because that's what I'm happiest doing. The work I valued the most was when I felt like I was helping others. I have been a volunteer at women's domestic violence shelters for the last 8 years on and off, and I've seen how these women work so hard to grow on their own and be financially independent. It's inspired me to do the same. ","A lot of my technical experience is self taught. For fun I used to edit HTML pages in high school and college. I taught myself basic photoshop in that time as well so I could make fun GIFS and photo edits for the online pages. I never was able to build something from scratch but I could edit colors, alignment, etc. When I worked in Tech, this worked to my advantage as I had to make very minor edits to one of our webpages as part of my role. It was even more basic than when I used to edit before, since this was mainly editing written content and aligning it. I have experience with a lot of technical programs such as Microsoft Office, Photoshop, Adobe PDF, G Suite, etc but I wouldn't exactly call myself an expert in any of those corners.

If I'm accepted to the Tech Moms program, my immediate goal is to learn the basics of coding and web development. I believe the Tech Moms program could be crucial in helping me bridge the gap between where I am right now and where I want to be. The Tech Moms program will allow me to participate in a support group of like-minded women with similar goals, to gain more confidence in my skills, and to develop better familiarity with the current work landscape. Following completion of the Tech Moms program, I believe I will then have the skill set and confidence to reach my intermediate goal of enrolling in a coding bootcamp. In the bootcamp, I hope to deepen my understanding and experience with the coding languages that will help me become employable as a web developer. During these preparation programs, I will be trying to gain experience from every possible opportunity, so that I will be fully prepared to achieve my long-term goal of going directly into a tech job afterward. I'm specifically interested in web development, but I am open to learning about other types of tech careers that spark my interest. My ultimate goal right now is to pursue a stable long-term career in web development. I hope to be continually learning, staying on top of new changes in the industry. ","The biggest barrier I face in my career right now is that it's difficult to go back to traditional school for new skills or a career change, because of time constraints, family needs, and the financial commitment. I have young children in elementary school who still need a lot of my time and energy, and traditional school doesn't always work with that. It's also daunting to return to a full-time career after being away from regular work while I've been a stay-at-home mom. Though I have done some editing in my free time, it's been over a decade since I've worked full time. Also, while I am very interested in the tech industry, I have limited experience with it. Tech Moms will allow me to start from scratch and build basic skills, show me possible paths I can take in the future, and do all this in a supportive environment with others in a similar situation to me. I'm excited for this program because I think it'll be a safe space for me to work hard and develop my confidence and experience. I think the support and connections will be a huge help in allowing me to enter into this new career.","Being a parent is one of the most challenging things I have ever done. I've had to confront aspects of my upbringing and experience that were not helpful for me as a parent, and I've had to dig deep into reserves of strength I didn't think I had. Searching out helpful communities has been incredibly important, and I've spent hours pursuing new knowledge and resources. I've gained valuable skills for interpersonal relationships as well as a better understanding of what I can do for my own health and well being. For example, one of my children has sensory issues. This was totally new territory for me, and I knew I'd need more than my own knowledge in order to give him the right support. I consulted many different sources, learned what this experience can be like from the child's perspective, and gained valuable tools for interacting with him. I've also been gratified to see my efforts help him develop his own strategies for dealing with this issue. All these challenges that have come as part of parenting have given me incredible opportunities to grow as an individual, and I've learned that I can always evolve and improve.

Many vendors and subs were in line to contribute, and had contributed, with the expectation for advertising in the Parade of Homes.  I had never built a home before or anything of the sort.  I knew I had to do it, so I went to work finding subs, lining them up, learning about how work needed to be done, working with the bank on the construction loan, paying bills and keeping all the financial aspects in check, making sure subs did their job correctly and charged fairly and within budget, etc. and doing a lot of the work myself where there were gaps etc.  It was an unusually cold and wet winter, which caused many complications, to add to the situation.  This was one of the hardest, most challenging things I've ever done, but I knew I had to do it, so I went to work and figured it out.

In March 2020, when the pandemic hit and altered our lives so drastically, I was at the helm of this organization as we determined how to respond and keep our group intact and thriving.  It was a challenging year that followed!  So many difficult decisions and complicated logistics faced us. Initially, we continued to meet online to finish the school year.  Then, before the next year began in the fall, we had to determine if we could meet in person, how to ensure the health and safety and comfort of our group, and we had to be creative as we tried to keep things as ""normal"" as we could.

","  My lack of experience is a huge barrier I face when applying to jobs. Since we frequently moved, my resume is full of gaps and job changes. My age is also a barrier. I am nearly 40, so the gaps and periods of unemployment are less likely to be overlooked. I believe there is an expectation that a person my age should have more experience at this point in life. Although most will express support of military families, I’ve found that the realities that shaped my life as a military spouse are not excused in the hiring process. Lastly, my Political Science and Women’s Studies degrees are not impressive to most employers. I was a great student and excelled academically. It’s frustrating that I often can’t express that on my resume. I feel like the type of degree is all that is considered. ","As a military spouse, I moved 6 times in 12 years. Finding a job was not easy, and since jobs on or near bases are often scarce, it’s also very competitive. Despite these odds, I managed to work at nearly every assignment.

I need something that allows and supports me in being a mother, but also acknowledge that there will be a time (many years) I will likely continue in this field and want it to be something I enjoy.  I like the prospect of being able to return to an office, and actually be with people.

I would love to be able to retire and know I will be taken care of.  I am uncertain about a lot of specifics, and hope to gain more clarity as I begin down this path.  But for short term goals, I know I need something where I can be making a decent income within 3-4 yrs.  I see benefits in potentially working with a company out east (remotely) or a more flexible company here, where my hours can begin early and end near the time my children are off school.

I can say, I know I have struggles to focus and follow through/be consistent, and can imagine those weaker organization skills could prove a struggle in the area I'm looking into.  But I feel like those are things I can learn and can strengthen.  Right now, perhaps the biggest barriers are trying to balance everything I have going on (figuring out the next step and following through on a path), and filtering through the what feels like are MILLIONS of potential options out there (I've navigated and made decisions with some of these but - do I go to college, what careers should I pursue, how do I go from someone who knows very little to being a manager, which position should I apply for first, etc. etc. etc.)","It's difficult to pinpoint or name a specific challenge; however, I feel challenges in my life, and have certainly overcome (or am in the process of overcoming), and I think if I had to spell out the things I've learned it's 1. That I am loved.  2. That the light will come - that sometimes the things we fear aren't as bad as we imagined and fear itself was the worst part, and other times even when it's dark and deep, and feels it will never end, it will.  3. That often times what we imagined to be the ""best possible"" solution, wasn't anywhere close to what we were given... that everything lead to this moment and things that we didn't dare hope for actually are exactly what God had in store all along.","My husband worked in the industry so I feel I'm somewhat familiar with the language, but don't necessarily understand what it means.

When I went on maternity leave, I had two seprate male contractors ask my supervisor for my permanent job. They never spoke to me directly, only to my boss. How often does this happen to men in their jobs when they welcome a baby? While on this same maternity leave, my work cell phone number needed changed because several customers wouldn't stop calling. I was working 40+ hours a week, and I was constanly on-call for the entire IT infrastructure department. My annual reviews were outstanding but I was being passed over for pay increases or promotions for my male counterparts. My male counterparts were able to successfully argue that I was a second income as a female (although my husband didn't have benefits or a permanent position). It wasn't until a female supervisor saw this and spoke up for me in a larger meeting that I got a pay raise. I also couldn't find quality daycare for my child. When I eventually asked to move to part-time hours as I had seen other women in the company transition to, I was told no. The IT department was afraid to lose a full-time position. When the vice president of IT asked what it would take for me stay, he acknowledged that I was a hard worker and would get more done part-time than most anyone they could hire to replace me full-time. Even with that, I coudn't find a part-time position within the company I had been at for nearly ten years. The fear that they would be stuck with a part-time position in the event I ever left was so terrifying to them that they wouldn't do it.  ","When I started working in IT, there were only a handful of women attending conferences. They were generally referred to as token females. This was a stereotype I never wanted to be labeled. I worked harder than any man on my team, I carried my weight (literally, I wouldn't ask for help carrying an item if a man didn't also ask for help). I had to be happy with carryinf responsiblities others didn't want and I tried hard to make sure that problems were resolved with me. I didn't pass on problems, I solved them or stayed with the issue until it was resolved.  At the time, it wasn't always easy. However, as time passed, I developed a reputation as a hard worker and someone others could turn to if they needed help. I thoroughly enjoyed my job.","I have a Bachelor's in Information Systems from USU. My work experience was in IT infrastructre. I was working with virtual machines before they became commonplace. My experience is with active directory, exchange, and server administration. I work well interfacing between IT and the customer who doesn't know a lot about IT.

I've been looking for ways to develop myself professionally, and the opportunities are tricky to take advantage of.","One of my life's biggest defining moments was when I applied for a job as a school librarian in a school I had taught in for 4 years. I had been told by numerous colleagues, when they found out I was pursuing a master's degree in library science, that I would be perfect for the job. When it came down to it, I did not get the job--even though most of those same people who had praised me and encouraged me were actually on the hiring committee. They ultimately chose someone who was not as qualified as I was, but whom they had a longer working history with. to say I felt devastated is an understatement. I worked through my feelings and used it as an opportunity to take some time to meet a lot of goals I had been putting off. I visited a friend I hadn't seen for many years, successfully finished my master's degree, and trained for and ran a marathon. That gave me my confidence back so that I was ready to move forward when the next opportunity presented itself. My friend's company had a job opening for a temp worker, and I applied. It was a good fit, and I've been with the company for 10 years now. I relocated to keep the job, and because of that I met my husband and we created our beautiful little family. Things would be quite different if I had gotten that librarian job, and although I might still be confused about their decision, I'm glad they made it.","I took a class on web development basics in 2010, and I know enough code to edit text with HTML or XML tagging.

I hope to find a job with my updated skills that allows me to combine my interest in healthcare with technology.,"I think the biggest barrier I face right now is that I haven't worked outside of the home for 18 years. When I worked as an epidemiologist at the state health department, I was given a palm pilot because we didn't use cell phones yet! I am familiar with basic applications on the computer, but my technology skills are definitely lacking. I did a short internship recently at my local health department and I lacked the confidence necessary to complete a lot of skills I was asked to do because my technology skills were out of date. I was eventually able to accomplish the tasks, but it took me a lot longer to figure out how to do it. So not having worked outside of the home and not having new, relevant skills seem to be my biggest barriers.  ","When I went to college 20 years ago, I wanted to live away from home and attend BYU-Idaho (known as Rick's College). Coming from a large family, my parents were unable to afford to pay for my education so I knew that I had to work hard in school to get scholarships and that I would need to get a job in college as well. Thanks to my grades, I was able to get my full tuition paid for through an academic scholarship. Because I also had to pay for my housing, I got certified as a CNA and worked at the local nursing home during college. It made for some tough days of studying and I also didn't have a car so many times I had to walk to work in the cold and snow. But I was proud of all the hard work that I put into achieving the grades I did and was grateful for the opportunity to attend college. I believe that these challenges helped me appreciate my schooling, taught me the sweetness of hard work and also made me more resilient to the challenges I have faced since. It also taught me that sometimes the most difficult times can also be the most rewarding. ","I have done data entry,  and used Microsoft Office applications, and Google Drive.

The concept behind this goal is having the ability to offer assistance handling backend data management which is lacking within our current group. My long term goals for my career include successfully petitioning for the creation of an insurance dedicated team within our department as well as establishing myself in a key back-end role within this team. The first of these goals is a point I have been urging to all who will lend me their ear, and proving the agents involved can create smooth functionality would be a massive stepping stone to success. I firmly believe that the skills acquired through the Tech-Moms program would provide the ability to reach these goals.","The biggest barriers I have faced in my career, so far, have been acclimating to the corporate social environment and finding ways to integrate my artistically driven mind with the demands of the business world. While the corporate world is becoming open minded to allowing employees more self-expression, a small number of individuals maintain a guarded mindset against alternative people in substantial business roles. This has often created awkard social interactions in the workplace, which I have quickly learned to adapt to and overcome. In additon, while my experience may be vast and ranged, a majority of it has not involved the business world. However, learning the functions of a major operation such as 1-800 Contacts, especially the interactions between back-end technology and customer impact, has allowed me to use my personal maxims to benefit a large number of people. This knowledge alone has provided the motivation to overcome any barrier set before me and utilize my unique perspective to create further options for improvement.","One challege that I have overcome, simultaneously in a professional and personal sense, is self-motivation. While this hurdle became most apparent when initially transitioning from working in office to at home, the need for self-motivation became a significant aspect of daily life for me because this was only half of the major life changes that occurred at the same time. Shortly after transitioning to working from home, my husband and I took full-time custody of his youngest son. We have worked fervently and tirelessly to ease this change for him, and provide everything that was missing from his life previously. Having little to no previous parental experience, this was a major game-changer for me. From that point on, every aspect of my day-to-day life, including waking up early to get everyone prepared for their day, working from home, walking my stepson to and from school, maintaining the household, and handling business calls and paperwork for the band between each task has demanded a strong sense of self-motivation. From these challenges I have learned that giving up is not an option, the urges to be lazy will not only negatively impact you, but everyone and everything around you. The road to success is paved with motivation, and you are the only one who can supply it.","My previous technical experience includes a Front-End Engineering Certification from Bottega University and the on-the-job education collected while actively utilizing a number of various programs to achieve my daily professional goals. While I feel these experiences have allotted me an upper hand in the technological world, I still do not have a sense of confidence in my skills, nor are many of them applicable to my current position or the path of growth available beyond my current position.

In the long-term, I’d love to apply the greatest set of my skills, both soft skills and technical skills to found a community that supports the development of fully circular / sustainable urban communities. Whether I launch this community myself or join a community that is further along towards these ends, it is extremely important to me that I can use a combination of both my soft and technical skills to create the most value towards this mission. I see development as both a means to an end (in that demand for these roles is high, and it will help me pay the bills) and an end in and of itself in that it will help me build towards these long-terms goals in new ways. I also believe it’s important to have greater representation and a greater diversity of thought, across genders, races, and otherwise, in technology in order to help the field innovate to the extent it is able. Towards these ends, being seated at the table and being able to communicate across teams of individuals in tech and non-tech roles will help me become a better leader and advocate for others wanting to get into more technical roles.","Overall, I think I've been pretty lucky in finding great teams to work with. In terms of the barriers I’ve run into, when it comes to finding and applying to roles, I think I've sold myself short when asking for pay (especially on independently contracted roles) and when proving myself in interviews due to verbal queues that might suggest a lower level of confidence. I think I also haven't always been the best at vouching for and communicating the skills and knowledge that I bring to the teams I join. I find myself leaning on skills and roles I’ve been previously involved with (sales and partnerships), instead of diving into more advanced or newer, more challenging roles for me. As a result, I’ve felt that I’ve been stagnating a bit in terms of my growth and in my career overall. For these reasons, I've been intent as of late to go back to school and develop new skills especially in tech that help me better communicate and demonstrate the skills I am bringing to new teams even before they hire me.","My previous roles have most frequently been with startups consisting of less than 5 people. Working on teams this small can be challenging in a few ways. The teams and at times the business as a whole is usually very disorganized & unstructured, especially when you're joining a team of one, and as a first hire, or early employee. In order to build in some structure for myself within these roles and a clear understanding of my job responsibilities, I need to be very clear on what my needs are, great at asking questions, and exceptional at notating structure to aid in the onboarding of future employees. Working with an early and disorganized early-stage startup, I've also needed to develop a lot of patience, work on my own self-awareness, and practice leadership skills. If I can do these things early on and establish really good communication within my teams, these roles are so dang fulfilling! So long as I continue to reflect on the roles, the challenges, and the product or business itself, and consciously reflect on how it evolves, I can do really well in these roles.","While completing my bachelor’s degree, I was able to practice statistical analysis and get some technical experience in R, Stata, and Tableau. More recently, I have gotten the very basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript in a beginner’s Udemy course and on Replit. I have also been a technical recruiter and have taken courses designed for technical recruiters hoping to learn the basic structures and workings of development teams and developer job requirements.

I want to find something that makes enough money to be able to afford to live and buy a house. I want to enjoy my job and not wake up feeling dread and hatred towards what I do. ","The challenge above states it well. Dealing with the parents is so hard. They a lot of the times are great, but every once in awhile (which is happening more and more often) are starting to feel that they are entitled to certain things. Or their child gets to do whatever they would like. There is a lot of behavior issues that parents just ignore and don't care about because it's not happening at home. Another barrier is everything that the district is throwing on us. They are having us do a massive training that is basically everything I learned in college. I feel that it is just adding to the workload that I don't need. The biggest thing that I would say is a barrier is not being able to spend as much time as I would like to with my son. I only get to see him for about an hour a day before he goes to bed. It is killing me. I hate that I have to take him to daycare everyday. He is starting to get in the age where he doesn't want to go and it breaks my heart. ","At the beginning of this school year, I had a parent who was very upset that her child could not eat in my classroom. We have a child with severe allergies are not allowed to have food in our class or he could have a reaction. I explained this to the parent, told her that we could easily let her child go to the office and grab a quick snack and then head back to class. She was livid and would not stand for this. I had already gone to my principal with the issue so that he was aware of it. This mom of course contacted him and told him that I wasn't allowing her child to eat and I was being unreasonable. He reinforced what I had said about my student with severe allergies and how it was a district policy that we couldn't have food in our classrooms with allergies. She again got very upset. Then she went to Facebook. She posted about it on the local community Facebook group and slandered my name all over the place. This was very hard for me. My principal told me not to say anything as it could make matters worse. She was making up lies and all kinds of things to anyone who commented. I felt extremely defeated. This mom emailed the principal and told him that her child would not be returning to my class and she would like a different teacher. We arranged for her to be in a different class, but that wasn't good enough for the mom, so she just ended up pulling her child out of our school and putting her in a different school. I have never had anything happen like this before and it made me question myself. I wondered if I wasn't doing what I should have been doing, if I wasn't a good teacher like she said, etc. But I quickly realized that I wasn't going to let this ruin me. I know I am a good teacher. I know that I was doing what was best for the other students in my class and I was following the district's policy, so there wasn't much I could change anyway. I learned during this time that I again can do hard things. I was able to move past it and keep going to work everyday with a smile on my face for my students. I learned that I do everything for my students. I also learned that this is not what I want to be doing for my entire life. I learned that even though my administration had my back, I still couldn't stand up for myself and I couldn't do anything about my name being thrown everywhere.

Or doing freelance work for women launching businesses. I would like to start my own business that helps women learn how to care for themselves at any age or physical ability level, how to advocate for themselves and their children, and how to be engaged in their communities to create positive local change. I have small and enormous life goals—the main goal is to develop a new, useful skill that can help me fine-tune my goals. I want to do everything I can—even though I feel like I am so late to the game—to create a good life for myself so I can be an emotional and financial support to my daughters. They need a good example and I will be able to afford more healthcare options for myself (and more support for their schooling) if I can get a job.","Chronic pain, CPTSD (that is officially diagnosed as PTSD, ADHD, anxiety, situational depression, & fibromyalgia—but it is thought that my real diagnosis is C-PTSD, a diagnosis that has never been formally recognized in the DSM despite being recommended for adoption)","My entire life has been a challenge. I was run over by a truck (front and back tire over my torso) when I was 18 months old and was medically and emotionally neglected by my parents my entire life (because they were protecting their own emotional needs instead of my physical and emotional needs). We went through an armed home invasion in San Francisco when I was 5 and I have been blamed my whole life for giving my hair ribbons to the burglars to tie us up—but I believe I may have saved our lives instead of ""helped"" the bad guys. I grew up being told to not talk and that my physical complaints were lies and selfishness. I was raped at 14, 17, and 21. I have had multiple abusive partners. I self medicated through college with alcohol and heavy smoking. But then I realized I wanted to NOT be the 60 year old lady hanging out at the bar hitting on young college guys, so I moved away from college, got a job at a nonprofit in the Washington DC area, quit drinking and smoking cold-turkey, finished school through correspondence classes, and then moved out to SLC to take care of an elderly relative with the plan of going to graduate school in nutrition. I took classes in economics for fun and that changed my trajectory—until I had my major medical emergency that brought my childhood accident back to the surface. I needed health insurance and a paid graduate program, so I applied to go to school in the sciences. I did very well despite my previous challenges—until I got fired for asking for medical leave (it's a longer story than that, but that's the gist of it). That was the single most difficult moment of my life. Far worse than an armed home invasion. Far FAR worse than rape. School *in the sciences* is supposed to be a safe environment where skill, hard work, and accomplishment are rewarded and it was devastating to me to find myself being seen in the same way my parents had seen me: as a liar, as selfish, as undeserving of help. I reacted by being unable to stay awake for 3 months. I would have been suicidal if I had had the energy. It has taken me a long time but I have learned to be more mindful of my own health, to learn to value myself and not rely on other people to value me, and to understand that it is my responsibility to be my own advocate. I was unable to advocate for myself when I was fired from graduate school because the event was a direct tie into a childhood experience I hadn't even fully appreciated until I had my own kids and I was suddenly aware of how horrific it would be to run over one of my own children with a car and then deny them their own reality of pain and need. I had never learned to be a person—or that I even deserved to be one. Now, I know that I am someone and I deserve to have a good life. And I want to do everything I can—even though I feel like I am so late to the game—to create a good life for myself so I can be an emotional and financial support to my daughters.

Long- term I would like to teach and educate again,"Currently, I am on short-term disability for another few weeks. I was trying to push through difficult days, being gone 10 hours a day and on my days off I had to sleep it off. Through specialized physical therapy it was found that I was dealing with a brain injury and the long work days were too much. I am on the tail end of the short term disability but will be limited to shorter work days. For me to provide better for my family and heal I would like to open a new door. ","After a lengthy divorce as I was feeling that our life was turning a positive corner, I became progressively sick with some mysterious illness, that literally had me passing out at home, grocery stores, and doctors offices. I always felt the weight for being a single mom that had her kids 24/7 and didn't want to be viewed as a burden or shamed, so I worked hard to make a better life for my little boys and myself. Yet, when I could no longer stand on my own, drive, make dinner, and so forth, I had to have help. People from my community signed up and helped me with all the daily ins and out. They dressed my kids and got them off to school, brought meals, helped with homework, took me to doctors appointments. It was a humbling experience as I couldn't return the kindness other than send a ""Thank You"" card, but what I could do was listen to their stories! As people came to sit with and keep an eye on me, I asked about them, and to my surprise I found the most beautiful stories of triumphs, tragedies, heartbreaks, funny jokes, favorite songs & colors, dreams and goals, as well as fears, and regrets, and love stories found that these experiences made up the shaping of these beautiful lives!  I look normal, like I don't have any issue, but I now have  a great deal more compassion with people around me.  In this process we found out that we had been exposed to a toxin and that had caused the problems for myself and my children.  When I was able to go to work part-time I chose to work at a hospital in Radiology because, not only do I know  solid fundamentals about how the body works but  I had been a patient there! I knew what it was like to not know what scan after scan was going to show. I wanted to offer some comfort to those that were scared of what the scan would show. I have been able to do this many times now. ","I know some basic things.

I want to be confident and authentic.  ","The challenge I wanted to talked about happened 9 years ago, a year after my college graduation.  At the time, I was working  as an accountant for a clothing company in CA, they design their clothes in CA, produce them in southern China, and ship the clothes back to the U.S. to sell them.   I loved the sunny California, financial independence and my manager.  It was fun to be finally doing something where I could see the direct results from my labor.  Our accounts receivables were decreasing as I made calls to different boutiques asking them to pay.   I was even getting pre-orders so that we did not need to call our customers when their inventory come.  I was having so much fun and working so hard.  The company was amazed by my hard work and agreed to sponsor me to get a work visa.  I was on student visa at the time and was allowed to work in the U.S. for a year after graduation.   When I hit the one year mark, I had two choices.  One was to return to China, and the other was to find a company that will sponsor me to get a work visa.  However, it’s a lottery system that decides who gets visas and who do not, and only 25% applicants will get their visas each year.   I was fortunate to find a company that was willing to Sponsor; however, it was unfortunate that I did not win the lottery.  I had to leave my job and return to school so that I could stay in the U.S. and continue my courtship with my then boyfriend and now husband.  I came back to Utah and registered in a language school taking courses that will help me prepare for GMAT.   I did not need the class, I needed the visa to legally stay in the U.S.  It was a difficult time, not only because I was using my savings to pay the expensive tuition, but I was also learning things that I already know or I could easily learn by myself.   It was mentally hard for me too, I was working at a good job with good pay, but now I am back without a job and no pay.  I felt like a failure, I even felt there was something wrong that I did that caused me lose the lottery.   I became depressed, discouraged and lost.  I asked why me, I was working so hard and why took it all away from me?   A few weeks have passed, I knew I can’t go on like this and that I needed to pick myself up and go on with life.  I went to the manager at the school and asked for a part time job so that I could cover some expenses.  I got a job writing a blog for them and putting together practice math problems for the math teacher.  I also reached out to two friends who I trusted, and I shared with them my struggles and feelings.  To my surprise, they  sympathized with me and told me that they saw how hard I worked to get the job and at the job.  And they too were frustrated with the immigration/visa system.  It was all in my head that everyone was laughing at me and at my situation.  My then boyfriend and husband now was with me every step of the way, and he encouraged me to still enjoy life even during hard times.   Things I learned from this experience are family is important (my husband and my two friends were like family to me.  They helped me through this difficulty), you have to be the one to decide to get up and move on, and you can still enjoy life while waiting for good things to come.

Long term I would love to find my way into the world of white hat hacking and cyber security. I see everyday the ever increasing threat of cyber attacks and I would love to be a part of the solution.,The biggest barrier is that I feel like I never found a career. I have had a lot of jobs I loved and stayed with long term. None of them I felt comfortable calling a career to do that I always felt would be settling for less than I am capable of.,"Personal: When I moved to Utah in 2018 I weighed 80 lbs. I was in the grips of an eating disorder and severely sick. I had not been employed in four years partly due to my illness and partly due to employment gaps from my husbands military career and transition back into the civilian world. He is a Utah native and convinced me to move here to find better medical and therapeutic treatment for myself. I will be honest I did not have high expectations, I felt almost completely like a lost cause. I have always believed in that age old notion ""It's better to try and fail than to never try at all."" and that is what kept me going. Through therapy I learned that my eating disorder is a symptom of complex post traumatic stress disorder due to a violent sexual experience at a young age. Unfortunately the experience also resulted in scar tissue that has left me struggling with fertility issues. We are hoping to start a family in the near future be it naturally, IVF, or adoption. Having a family wouldn't be possible, taking a step to find a career wouldn't be possible, and being able to proudly say I am 150 lbs and happy in recovery wouldn't be possible if I had not moved here. I have found the nourishment I truly need here. The overwhelming amount of love and support I have found in Utah have truly been vital to my healing process. I do feel confident in my recovery and my perseverance. I know beating that, that there is nothing I cannot accomplish if I truly want it for myself. Unlearning my trauma based coping mechanisms and replacing them with love, healing, and self acceptance. Was the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I learned to never give up, even if you only have a shred of hope left, you still have hope, and that's something. We are not capable of controlling everything, and that is okay, but the things we can control we put those in order and we create goals to work towards and that is what gives life meaning and purpose.",None other than the ones I have gained in standard clerical positions.

506,Dead Lead,Non-responsive,Pleasant Grove,Utah,,0,Laptop (Mac),Employed full-time (35 hrs+),,High School Science Teacher,$35K-$50K,Married,$35k - $50k,Bachelor's Degree,"Short term, I want to gain the skills and knowledge necessary in order to enter into the tech field. I want to transition to a career that gives more support to its employees. I want to find a job where I don’t feel constant anxiety and fatigue each week. I have always found that I can work hard without feeling burned out; however, teaching introduced me to an entirely new type of hard work that involved working with disrespectful kids. I found that I quickly reached my limit in this kind of work. I hope that moving to a type of work that continues to utilize my love of STEM, but removes the daily struggle of dealing with teenagers, I will be able to show that I can work hard and achieve the goals that I have.   Long term, I want to find a career that I can love doing for a long time. I want to be able to find a job that is enjoyable enough to get me to stay without feeling stuck doing something I hate. I also want to find a company that emphasizes family life and allows me to be flexible as a mother. Whether that means working part time, or from home. The tech industry really appeals to me in this sense because I know that there are countless job opportunities and options available to me if I am able to gain the skills necessary for the field. ","Currently, I feel stuck in my career. I want to expand out from teaching. I have decided that I want to find a career that is more fulfilling to me. Unfortunately, I feel that the specificity of my degree leaves me with few options outside of education. I feel that if I could grow my skills in tech, and specifically coding, I would have the opportunity to leave education and pursue a different career.   A large barrier that I face is knowing what steps to take in order to change my career. Up to this point in my life, I have had a college major that I could change or access to undergrad courses that allowed me to explore different avenues of work. Now that I’m graduate, I face the barrier of not knowing where to turn or what to do in order to change the direction of my career and ultimately my life. That is one reason that the Tech Moms program appealed to me so much. I feel that the program would not only teach me valuable industry skills, but that it would also help me know what next steps need to be taken in order for me to succeed in the tech field. ","My parents divorced when I was young, and I grew up with an abusive father. This is perhaps the biggest personal challenge I’ve yet to face in my life. At first, this trial resulted in my feeling inadequate and even worthless at times. I clung to one of the only things I could control in my life; my ability to succeed in school. I found that hard work paid off and I could see the positive results of my efforts. As difficult subjects or projects came my way, I found myself thinking that if I could survive my life with my father, I could surely learn calculus, or write a successful paper for my English teacher. And while this lesson seemed to only apply at school, I quickly learned that I could do hard things outside of my schoolwork.   Over time, I came to realize that I was capable of doing hard things, not because I was being forced to do them—as was the case with my father—but because I could choose to do my best. I realized that my self-worth was not reliant on my abilities, but rather, who I was inside. I discovered my resiliency. I found that I enjoyed challenging myself and I wasn’t quick to give up. I learned that if I stuck through difficult experiences, I could learn more about myself and about the task at hand. It instilled in me a desire to do my best and simultaneously be gentler with myself.   The culmination of this lifelong lesson has resulted in my seeking out a challenging and fulfilling life. When faced with hard tasks, I am quick to begin working towards a resolution rather than running away. When it seems that my own abilities will be insufficient, I am not afraid to ask for help or look for resources to help me. But I have an inalienable confidence that I can do hard things. ","The extent of my technical experience involves learning new software, and using Excel while participating in undergraduate research. I am certainly an amateur when it comes to using formulas in Excel, but I can often figure out what I need to do based on previous training and with the use of Google.

I was devasted, I had just had my second baby 6 months earlier and was dealing with an undiagnosed thyroid problem and post partum depression as well. Throughout all of those years trying to finish my nursing degree I learned that there are many paths to get you to your goals and even if you might fail you can always try again and persevere until you succeed. I finally got my nursing license in February of 2020 and was pregnant with my 3rd child and the timing worked out bc I was able not work during the height of the pandemic which I would have if I had graduated when I was supposed to.

My long term goals are to retire my husband early and become a well-respected manager in the workforce.","Being a woman in Utah comes with two issues joining the workforce: I know I'll never be paid as much as my male cohorts and others assume that I have less experience and skill because I'm a woman. However, the biggest barrier is the fact that if I want to go back to work full time, I need to have confidence and 100% certainty that I'm sending my kids to the best day care ever when I drop them off. In addition to that, I must be able to afford that kind of care, and also provide for their needs.","My mental health took a dive into the deepest darkest place after I had my second child. I didn't recognize myself and was scared of what was happening. I went to four different specialist that all told me I was fine or mis-diagnosed me. I couldn't figure out why I was changing into something I can only describe as a monster. Medications were failing me and relationships were reaping at the seams. After a medical complication and a divorce threat, I knew something needed to change. I started applying for jobs and quickly realized I was skill-less. I went back to a job that required no skills so I could work part time. Despite it feeling like a step backwards, I realized that I thrived when I got that part time escape. I felt needed, appreciated, and free from the constant needs a tiny human can demand on a mother. I felt like I could breathe. I kept going with this new found freedom and took classes I enjoyed such as yoga and mountain biking. I eventually started my own business teaching kids the basic fundamentals of mountain bike riding. And I realized that what I was experiencing in my life was loneliness and identity-crisis that some moms face. I learned from this life-changing experience that having people in my circle to support me to grow and do better was imperative. There was no way I would've been able to work outside of the home if I didn't have people to watch my children, and be happy for me when I did. I learned that picking myself up also has to come from within--external help can only go so far.

789,Dead Lead,Non-responsive,kaysville,Utah,,3,Laptop (PC),"No, currently not employed outside the home",Not currently employed,,I do not currently work outside the home.,Married,$35k - $50k,Bachelor's Degree,I would just like to work in an area where I feel like I am contributing. While my children are young I would like to be able to work part time but when they get older I would love to be able to jump more into the workforce in a full time position.,One of the biggest barriers I am facing with the career I studied for is that I had my first child right after I graduated and so I was only able to work as a nurse full time for a few months. Since then I have just been at home with my kids. I have tried several times to apply for nursing positions but as a mom I can only work part time and so far I have not found anyone willing to hire me with so little experience for a part time nursing position.,"One challenge that I had to overcome occurred when I was obtaining my nursing degree. We would do several hours each semester of training in the hospitals where we were assigned to work alongside a nurse. One particular time, I was assigned to work with a rather difficult nurse. She wasn't interested in helping me learn and instead would just go to my instructor and complain about how much I didn't know. I felt overwhelmed with the idea of having to work with that nurse all day and it was difficult for me to hold back tears at several things that she would say to me or about me. I decided to try to do my best regardless of the help I did or did not receive. I decided to try my best to help the patients we were assigned with what I knew I could do. I remember we had one patient in particular who was an older woman. She had a terminal cancer and seemed really miserable. We were having a difficult time keeping her nausea under control. I tried really hard to be an advocate for her and I continuously checked in on her to help her reposition or put a cool washcloth on her head. I also sat and held her hand and talked with her when I checked in on her and found her crying. Even though I didn't learn as much as I could have if I would have had a more helpful training nurse, I still felt like I was able to take initiative on my own and find purpose and I learned a lot about how to advocate for my patients.

1151,Dead Lead,Non-responsive,Bogotá,Florida,,5,Laptop (PC),Employed part-time (under 20 hrs),Individual Contributor,Marketing Researcher,<$15K,Married,<$15k,Bachelor's Degree,"In the short term, my primary objectives revolve around furthering my expertise as an AWS architect and establishing myself as a trusted provider of related services, whether through employment in a reputable organization or as an independent freelancer. By leveraging my comprehensive skill set, I aim to assist businesses in transitioning to the digital realm by offering web development services, enhancing their social media presence, creating engaging blog content, optimizing their Google business profiles, producing impactful promotional videos, formulating effective networking strategies, and implementing targeted email marketing campaigns. By integrating these capabilities, I aspire to empower businesses with the tools and strategies needed to thrive in the digital landscape.  Additionally, I am keen on expanding my client base in a separate venture dedicated to teaching organizational and productivity skills. This endeavor would allow me to share my knowledge and experience, enabling individuals and organizations to optimize their efficiency and achieve their goals. To further enhance my credibility in this field, I plan to acquire relevant certifications, particularly in the United States, with the long-term aspiration of relocating there with my family.  By setting and achieving these short and long-term goals, I aim to unlock new opportunities for professional growth, broaden my impact on businesses and individuals, and cultivate a fulfilling and prosperous career trajectory."," Throughout my career, I have encountered significant barriers, with the most prominent being the limited opportunities and hindered promotions I have faced as a result of gender bias. Unfortunately, I had the unfortunate experience of working under a female supervisor who harbored a disdain for me due to my status as a mother. This hostile work environment manifested in various forms, including the deprivation of responsibilities and undermining my ability to contribute through active silencing. Despite consistently delivering strong performance and making notable strides in my personal life, these unjust circumstances impeded my professional advancement.  Presently, my primary obstacle revolves around securing an opportunity to work as an AWS architect in the technical field. While I am actively pursuing training and development in this domain, finding suitable employers who recognize my potential has proven to be challenging. Nevertheless, I remain resolute in my pursuit, determined to overcome this barrier and establish myself in this coveted role.  It is disheartening to encounter such barriers that are rooted in gender bias, as they undermine equal opportunities and hinder professional growth. However, I am committed to continuing my professional journey with unwavering resolve, seeking out organizations and individuals who appreciate my skills, expertise, and dedication. I am confident that my perseverance, coupled with ongoing training efforts, will eventually yield the desired outcome and propel me forward in my career as an accomplished AWS architect.","One significant challenge I encountered was the need to reschedule a project from a 12-month timeline to just 9 months due to my pregnancy. Despite this unexpected circumstance, I approached the situation with determination and adaptability, ultimately achieving successful outcomes. This experience provided me with invaluable lessons in teaching, delegation, fostering belief in others, and effective leadership.  Through this challenge, I learned the importance of imparting my knowledge and skills to my team members, empowering them to take ownership of their tasks and responsibilities. It was a transformative realization that everyone possesses the capability to excel when given the opportunity and guidance. Prior to this experience, my focus had been primarily on individual performance, often hesitating to seek assistance. However, by embracing a collaborative approach, I discovered the power of teamwork and the potential for remarkable results.  The project in question entailed implementing an internal control system across four countries within the Andean region, involving a substantial workforce of over 350 participants. I successfully trained each individual to document their respective processes, establishing a self-monitoring strategy that yielded exceptional outcomes. As a result, my performance evaluation surpassed expectations, and I was personally recognized by the company president for my exceptional work.  This challenge not only allowed me to overcome personal and professional obstacles but also instilled in me a deeper appreciation for the significance of collaboration, mentorship, and recognizing the untapped potential within individuals. It was a transformative experience that enhanced my leadership skills, broadened my perspective, and reinforced the belief in the collective power of a motivated and empowered team.","I possess a diverse range of technical experience that spans various domains. I have a strong foundation in SQL databases, Python programming, Linux operating systems, and AWS as a service provider. Additionally, I have explored the capabilities of Google Cloud. I have solidified my expertise in AWS through certifications such as AWS ReStart and Cloud Practitioner.

In terms of web development, I have successfully crafted websites utilizing WordPress with the Divi builder, as well as Bootstrap. Furthermore, I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This comprehensive skill set has allowed me to independently undertake numerous projects for both personal endeavors and client-based initiatives.

Complementing my technical aptitude, I bring valuable corporate experience to the table as a seasoned project manager. I have held the esteemed PMP certification since 2007, which showcases my extensive background in effectively overseeing and executing projects within a structured corporate environment.

Collectively, my technical prowess and project management expertise form a solid foundation that enables me to tackle multifaceted challenges and deliver impactful solutions. These experiences have not only bolstered my technical acumen but have also instilled in me a proactive and results-driven mindset, essential for driving success in complex projects and initiatives.",,,Hispanic or Latina,,,,6/13/2023 7:34 AM,,rec79f5g4ynAh0gw1,https://airtable.com/shr1fzOzyoKPI9VJt?prefill_Link+to+Tech+Moms+Applications+Table=rec79f5g4ynAh0gw1&hide_Link+to+Tech+Moms+Applications+Table=true,L,623,https://airtable.com/appC7LKIP4AccWSht/shrKDpOExqrphWlgG?prefill_Link+to+Tech+Moms+Applications+Table=rec79f5g4ynAh0gw1&hide_Link+to+Tech+Moms+Applications+Table=true

I am currently working at a venture capital firm and would love to get more experience working in that space. I want to gain more exposure to technology and hope to start my own business someday. I have a passion for giving back, and long term would love to start my own nonprofit. The exact focus of that nonprofit could go a couple ways, I have passions for the foster care system and providing safe, stable home to children in need.

","I am very grateful that at this point in my life I have not had to experience some of life’s greatest challenges. The greatest challenge I have had to face was removing myself from a toxic work environment while doing business with family. I had uprooted my life to transfer schools from AZ to UT for an opportunity to come and join my uncle and cousin in their real estate business during COVID-19. Everything in AZ was shut down so I took this as an opportunity to come and work for my uncle. My older cousin had done something similar years before and it had worked out very well for her. The expectations I had going in and promises that he had made me ended up not being the case. I had gone through the process of getting my real estate license just to never get guidance or support from my uncle and to be kept in the same admin position for the next two years. I was being grossly underpaid, under appreciated, and manipulated by this family member. It was an extremely toxic work environment that had detrimental effects to my mental health which later would have effects on my education, personal life, and overall happiness. I eventually woke up and realized how unhappy I was an realized my value. I was able to overcome the rut I was stuck in and begin to see my value and begin to know I didn’t deserve to be treated the way I was allowing myself to be treated. I put in my two weeks and started on the path to getting back to myself. Through this challenge I learned to set boundaries and not let others try to bully you into changing your boundaries. I learned how to communicate better and stick up for myself. I also learned the importance of staying in tune with yourself, and not putting family or images above my self respect.
